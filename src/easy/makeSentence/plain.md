# Plain English Solution
<!-- Given a sentence, capitalise the first letter and add a full stop to the end. However, if the sentence already ends with some form of puncutation, leave it as is. -->


problem type: transformation
the end goal is to have everything in a sentense case, therefore; if a sentece starts with a capital letter and ends with a punctuation mark, we leave it as is. If the capital letter or full stop is missing, then we add/change what is missing. 
eg
"hi, I'm Kat." --> capitalise 'Hi'
"hi, I'm Pooja" --> capitalise and add fullstop
"Hello, kat and Pooja." leave as is
"Hello, what is your name?" leave as is
